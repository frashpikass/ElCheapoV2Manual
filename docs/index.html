<!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
<a name="chapter1"><h2>1. Introduction</h2></a>
<div>
	<p>
		Thank you for choosing ElCheapo!
	</p>
	<b>ElCheapo V2.1</b> is a Game Boy flash cart with the following features:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				<b>8MB of FLASH memory</b> (4MB dedicated to the ROM and 4MB dedicated to the firmware).
				<br>This flash memory can be overwritten a very high number of times (about 10000). It is slow to write and fast to read. Once a ROM image has been written to this memory, it is possible to run it countless times without need to rewrite it.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<b>128k of SRAM memory with no battery</b> (fully available to the currently running software).
				<br>
				This memory is overwritten with the latest savegame available every time you run the ROM from the flash memory.
				<br>
				Since there is no battery, this memory is cleared every time the Game Boy is turned off.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>microSD card slot</b>
			<br>
			The microSD card stores files to be loaded to the other two memories of the cart:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>.gb</i> files, for Game Boy ROM images to be loaded to the flash memory.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>.gbc</i> files, for Game Boy ROM images to be loaded to the flash memory.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>.sav</i> files, for common savefiles to be loaded to the SRAM.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>.rtc</i> files, to simulate internal clock status (used by ROMs like Pok&eacute;mon Gold/Silver).
						<b>!NEEDS FACT-CHECKING!</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>.state</i> files, to store a full memory state dump (incompatible with some ROMs, including LSDj).
						<b>!NEEDS FACT-CHECKING!</b>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The cart is fully compatible with ROM images which use mbc1, mbc2, mbc3, mbc5, including LSDj.
		<br>
		Keep in mind that the cart does not support:
		<ul>
			<li>Internal battery to keep the saves across shutdowns</li>
			<li>Internal real time clock (RTC)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</div>


<!-- CHAPTER 2 -->
<a name="chapter2"><h2>2. Compatible Game Boy models</h2></a>
<div>
	The ElCheapo v2.1 cart is <b>not compatible with all Game Boy models.</b>
	<p>
		It will not work correctly with some Game Boy Advance models and with some Game Boy Color motherboard revisions, especially 1, 3 and 4. In addition, Game Boy Color revision 1 has bugs in the sound generator section which make it unfit for chiptune production (LSDj included).
	</p>
	<p>
		To easily discover the Game Boy Color motherboard revision one could look into the battery compartment and read the number under the bottom left negative contact.
		<br>
		If no <tt>0X</tt> number is present or if you see only a couple of numbers like <tt>1-1</tt>, your Game Boy Colour is a revision 01 and so it is not compatible with the ElCheapo v2.1.
		<br>
		Numbers like <tt>02</tt>, <tt>05</tt> and <tt>06</tt> indicate compatible revisions.
		<br>
		You might even read the revision number in other parts of the motherboard, where it is written like <tt>CGB-CPU-0X</tt>, with <tt>0X</tt> as the revision number.
		<br>
		You can find some Game Boy Color motherboard examples <a href="https://gbhwdb.gekkio.fi/consoles/cgb/">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Compatibility problems with Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color revision 3 have been fixed since ElCheapo v2.2.
		<br>
		You can update your ElCheapo hardware for free (shipment cost excluded) by <a href="#chapter7">sending it to Ben Grimmett</a>.
	</p>
</div>


<!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
<a name="chapter3"><h2>3. Initial setup</h2></a>
<div>
	In order to setup your cart you will need:
	<ul>
		<li>
			A <b>microSD</b> card. It can either be SD or SDHC, but it must have a maximum size of 32 GB.
		</li>
		<li>
			A computer with a microSD card reader or an analogous adapter.
		</li>
	</ul>

	The workflow is the following:
	<ol>
		<li>
			Format the microSD card with a FAT32 file system. Choose the largest cluster size as possible.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create the <tt>SAVE</tt> directory at the root of the microSD card filesystem.
			<br>That directory will store the savefiles generated by the ROMs executed from flash memory (keep in mind that to store a savegame here you will need to give a long push to the button on the back of the ElCheapo while the software is running).
		</li>
		<li>
			Copy the ROM files from the computer to any position inside the microSD card.
		</li>
		<li>
			Safely remove the microSD card from the computer, disabling it from the specific menu before phisically unplugging it from the computer.
		</li>
	</ol>

	It is now possible to delicately insert the microSD card inside the ElCheapo cartridge.
	<br>Make sure you insert it in the correct way (the main face of the microSD should facing you when you look at the cart label; also, the contacts should be in the general direction of the ElCheapo's contacts).

<!-- CHAPTER 4 -->
<a name="chapter4"><h2>4. Use of the cart menu (Firmware 2.012)</h2></a>
<div>
	Once the ElCheapo cartridge has been inserted into the Game Boy, after turning the console on you will interact with the firmware of the cartridge.

	<div>
		<a name="chapter4-1"><h3>Splash screen</h3></a>
		<p>
			The splash screen is the first you will see after turning on the Game Boy.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Hitting the <b>D-PAD</b>, <b>A</b> or <b>B</b> will execute the ROM image which is currently available in the flash memory.
				</li>
				<li>
					Hitting the <b>SELECT</b> button will open the SRAM menu. <b>!NEEDS FACT-CHECKING!</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					Hitting the <b>START</b> button will open the main menu.
				</li>
			</ul>

							<h4>!!! WARNING !!!</h4>
							Updating the firmware is a delicate operation. To maximise your success rates it's advised to:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Check that the downloaded firmware version is correct. <b>Don't install v1.x firmware on ElCheapo v2.x hardware!</b>
									<br>
									You can find your ElCheapo hardware version written on the on the front of the cart PCB; the current firmware version is displayed after moving from the splash screen to the main menu.
								</li>
								<li>
									Make sure that the batteries of your Game Boy are fully charged before you update the firmware.
								</li>
								<li>
									Don't turn off the Game Boy until the new firmware has been fully flashed.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								In case the update fails and your ElCheapo is bricked, you can fix it by reflashing it with an external writer like the Joey (available <a href="https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/products/reader-writer-gen2?variant=51157011156">here</a>). 
								<br>
								If you don't have a Joey, you can <a href="#chapter7">ask Ben</a> to reflash your ElCheapo (you will have to provide for the shipping cost).

<!-- CHAPTER 5 -->
<a name="chapter5"><h2>5. Running a ROM from the cart</h2></a>
<div>
	<p>
		To run the currently available ROM in flash memory using the save file in the <tt>SAVE</tt> directory of the microSD, hit any key (but <b>START</b> or <b>SELECT</b>) at the splash screen.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the ROM is being executed, it is possible to update the corresponding save file in the <tt>SAVE</tt> directory of the microSD by <b>pushing and holding the ElCheapo button</b> on the back of the cartridge.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some ROMs will support save states with the ElCheapo. A save state is a complete memory dump of the SRAM and the Game Boy RAM.
		<br>
		With compatible ROMs, you can create a save state by giving a <b>fast push to the ElCheapo button</b> on the back of the cartridge.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>LSDj does not support save states</b> and will crash if the ElCheapo button is pushed quickly.
